# adventofcode
This is just a simple repo with my jurney of having fun with https://adventofcode.com/2022

I am trying to more or less follow draconian Uncle Bob's TDD principles as an exercise. Also usage of Flows is purely as a learning exercise.

# How to build and run
```shell
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/adventofcode-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```
This will show available commands
To run for example `day1` command:
```shell
java -jar build/libs/adventofcode-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar day1
```
